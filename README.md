# Airflow Data Processing Project

This project is an example of how to use Apache Airflow for automating data pipelines. It includes two workflows (DAGs) that demonstrate the full data processing lifecycle, from downloading data to preparing it for analysis.

1. **Data Download and Splitting Pipeline**:
   - The first workflow is responsible for fetching a dataset from a public source.
   - The data is split into two parts: Training Dataset and Fine-Tuning Dataset.
   - Both datasets are stored in the cloud for further processing.

2. **Data Cleaning and Processing Pipeline**:
   - The second workflow starts by downloading the Training Dataset.
   - This data is cleaned, which includes handling missing values and removing duplicates.
   - The data is then normalized and standardized to make it ready for analysis or machine learning.
   - Finally, the processed data is uploaded back to the cloud.

### Features of the Project

This project showcases the following features:

- **Automation**: Both workflows are fully automated and can be triggered manually or on a schedule.
- **Modularity**: Each task in the pipeline is separated into modular components for better readability and reusability.
- **Integration with Google Sheets**: Processed datasets are stored in Google Sheets for easy access and sharing.
- **Data Processing with Python**: Uses powerful Python libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn for handling and transforming data.

### How the Pipelines Work

1. **Step 1 - Downloading the Data**:
   - The first pipeline starts by automatically fetching a dataset. This could be a CSV file hosted online or on a local server.
   - The downloaded data is saved temporarily for processing.

2. **Step 2 - Splitting the Data**:
   - The dataset is split into two parts: one for training purposes and another for fine-tuning.
   - Both parts are uploaded to a cloud service, such as Google Sheets, for safe storage.

3. **Step 3 - Cleaning the Data**:
   - The second pipeline focuses on cleaning the Training Dataset by addressing missing values and removing duplicates.
   - This ensures that the data is high-quality and ready for further steps.

4. **Step 4 - Normalizing and Standardizing**:
   - The cleaned data is transformed to ensure all values are scaled appropriately.
   - Normalization and standardization are key steps to prepare data for machine learning.

5. **Step 5 - Uploading Processed Data**:
   - The final processed dataset is uploaded back to the cloud, making it accessible for downstream tasks or reporting.

### How to Set Up and Run

Here’s a simple guide to setting up and running this project:

1. **Install Python Libraries**:
   - Before starting, ensure you have Python installed.
   - Install the required dependencies using the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Start the Airflow Environment**:
   - Launch Apache Airflow using Docker Compose. This will start the webserver and scheduler.
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

3. **Access the Airflow Dashboard**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. This is where you can manage and monitor the workflows.

4. **Trigger the Workflows**:
   - In the Airflow dashboard, you’ll see the two pipelines (DAGs).
   - Trigger each DAG manually and observe how the tasks are executed.

### Next Steps and Improvements

This project can be further enhanced with the following improvements:

1. **Cloud Integration**:
   - Add support for other cloud storage services, such as AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage.
2. **Advanced Data Processing**:
   - Include more complex data transformations and feature engineering.
3. **Scheduling**:
   - Set up automatic scheduling for workflows to process data periodically.
